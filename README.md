# cli-kit
A collection of useful CLI commands for various scenarios, built for Windows machines.

## Requirements

In order to implement these scripts as suggested in [Loading the scripts](#loading-the-scripts), and to run some of the scripts themselves, you will require the [jq package](https://jqlang.org/). 

## Available scripts
| **Name**                     | **Command**    | **Aliases**     | **Flags**  | **Description**                                                                 | **Location**           |

| Go to projects               | gotoprojects   | gtp             |            | Navigates to the projects folder, defined by the PROJECTS_PATH variable in config file | [bash/gotoprojects.sh](./bash/gotoprojects.sh) |
| List projects                | lsprojects     | lsp             |            | Lists folders in projects, accepts all flags provided by `ls` command           | [bash/lsprojects.sh](./bash/lsprojects.sh) |

## Loading the scripts
If you enter the below script into `~/.bashrc`, then it will auto load these scripts from the manifest.json, using the location property

```shell
# START custom script loading
CLI_KIT_DIR="<PATH_TO_THIS_REPO>" #e.g. /c/user/dev/cli-kit

while IFS= read -r script_path; do
    script_path=$(echo "$script_path" | tr -d '\r')  # Remove ^M characters
    full_path="$CLI_KIT_DIR/$script_path"
    
    if [[ -f "$full_path" ]]; then
        source "$full_path"
    else
        echo "ERROR: File not found - $full_path"
    fi
done < <(jq -r '.scripts[].location' "$CLI_KIT_DIR/manifest.json" | tr -d '\r')
# END custom script loading
```

After updating the `~/.bashrc` file, you will need to reload your shell window. Run `lcs` to show the list of available scripts provided by this package.

## Config file
The `config` file contains key configuration settings, such as the `PROJECTS_PATH`, which defines the directory for your development projects. This allows scripts to dynamically reference the path, making the setup flexible and easily customizable across different environments.
